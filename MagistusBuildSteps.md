# üß† Magistus Build Steps Plus (Chronological Master Plan)

A full next-stage roadmap for the Magistus AGI system ‚Äî designed for phased, ethical, and technically progressive development. All steps honor the **Magistus Manifesto**, evolve toward **clustered cognition**, and expand persistent memory and persona modeling.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 12: Dual-Layer Memory Finalization

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Ensure `log_memory()` writes to both:

   * `memory_log.md` (narrative memory)
   * `memorystore.jsonl` (structured memory)
2. Add `load_memory_history()` function to retrieve and optionally summarize past records.
3. Introduce optional tags in structured JSON entries: `"type": "fact"`, `"goal"`, `"emotion"`, etc.
4. Begin writing Magistus‚Äôs own summary/persona entries into `magistus_profile.json` after each reasoning cycle.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 13: Autonomous Goal Inference & Evolution

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Improve `GoalTracker` to detect implied goals from natural language (e.g., "remind me to...", "I'd like to...").
2. Expand `log_json_memory()` to handle `"type": "goal"` entries and store them into `memorystore.jsonl`.
3. Introduce `goals.json` or integrate goal entries into existing JSON log.
4. Create `summarize_active_goals()` to review current intentions/goals.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 14: Self-Awareness / Persona Emergence

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Create `magistus_persona.json` to persist:

   * Interaction counts
   * Known skills/themes learned
   * System reflections (e.g., "I‚Äôve become more confident with goal inference.")
2. Update `ReflectiveAgent` to log insights to this file.
3. Include a `self_summary()` utility callable from within Magistus.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 15: Exploratory Memory Recall

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Implement `memory_query_router()`:

   * Use FAISS for similarity queries.
   * Use `memorystore.jsonl` and `memory_log.md` for tag/date-based filtering.
2. Create a new endpoint `/memory_search` or internal function callable by agents.
3. Add query result logs to `magistus_persona.json` (tracking recall quality and results used).

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 16: Memory Editing & Transparency Mode

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Assign UUID4 `memory_id` to each `.jsonl` memory item.
2. Build basic CLI or API editing tools:

   * `/edit_memory`
   * `/forget_memory`
3. Add `list_recent_memories()` with preview and ID-based selection.
4. Update `log_memory()` to include source/context links for full transparency.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 17: User Persona Modeling

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Create `user_profile.json` to track:

   * Tone/Style
   * Recurring themes
   * Personality indicators
2. Implement `UserPersonaBuilder` class.
3. Update agents (especially Prefrontal Cortex, DMN) to append insights post-cycle.
4. Enable Magistus to answer: "What do you know about me so far?"

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 18: Agent Role Specialization + Auto-Coop

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Add optional `target_of_reply` in `AgentThought`, allowing agents to reply to specific others.
2. Enable agents to flag disagreements or dependencies in their output.
3. Build prototype agents:

   * `ConflictResolverAgent`
   * `SynthesisAgent`
4. Fuse responses via cooperative strategy rather than just highest confidence.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 19: Reflective Reasoning Logs

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. After each cycle, add a `reflection:` string in `magistus_persona.json`, summarizing confidence, uncertainty, or emotion.
2. Let user rate responses with simple feedback: üëç / üëé or ‚ÄúWas this helpful?‚Äù
3. Store `feedback_score` or `user_rating` per entry in `.jsonl`
4. Use reflection data to adapt tone/strategy over time.

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 20: Ethical Safeguards + Policy Introspection

### üß© Chronological Steps:

1. Expand `ethical_compass.py` to scan each full reasoning cycle for boundary issues or privacy triggers.
2. Allow Reflective Agent to halt or flag responses (‚ÄúPausing to verify intent with the user...‚Äù).
3. Track frequency and type of ethical flags in `magistus_profile.json`
4. Summarize alignment consistency against the Manifesto every N cycles.

---

## üîú POST-20 BONUS PHASES (Preview)

* **Phase 21: Web Search Agent** ‚Äî add `web_search_agent` using SerpAPI or Brave.
* **Phase 22: Memory Graph** ‚Äî visualize `.jsonl` memory clusters as node graph.
* **Phase 23: Cluster Reasoning** ‚Äî introduce multi-agent whisperer loops.

## üîö Final Notes

This document replaces `Magistus Build Steps` as the **active roadmap**.
Follow the order strictly to ensure:

* No system overreach
* Minimal bugs/conflicts
* Full ethical and architectural alignment
