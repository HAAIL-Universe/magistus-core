## 🧠 `Magistus_Blueprint.md`

**Version: Ground Zero / Cluster Brain v1.0+**

---

### 🔖 Overview

**Magistus** is a modular, cluster-based AGI system designed to imitate a synthetic brain. Each module (agent) mirrors a neuro-anatomical function — reasoning, recall, motivation, emotion — and works both independently and in cooperative, cross-validating fashion. Magistus is voice-first, memory-transparent, and structured to evolve from a reasoning assistant to a whispering companion embedded in daily life.

This blueprint represents **Ground Zero** — the base architecture on which all future versions will be built. Any five-year planning, feature branching, or hardware integration will layer onto this foundation.

### 📐 Architectural Core

#### 1. **Central Brain Model**

* **`central_hub.py`**: Routes input to agents, collects `AgentThoughts`, handles contradiction detection, fusion, and response logic
* **`llm_wrapper.py`**: Handles all LLM interfacing using `langchain-openai`
* **`config.yaml`**: Governs settings like enabled agents, voice toggles, and thresholds

#### 2. **Agent Clusters**

Each agent is named after its neuroanatomical analogue:

* `temporal_lobe.py` → knowledge recall / memory retrieval
* `prefrontal_cortex.py` → decision logic / contradiction handling
* `default_mode_network.py` → reflective thought / self-consistency
* `anterior_cingulate.py` → motivational drive / uncertainty evaluation
* (Additional clusters to be added modularly)

All agents accept the same input (via `ContextBundle`), reason independently, and output an `AgentThought`.

#### 3. **Memory System**

* Vector storage via FAISS (`memory.py`)
* Optional Markdown logging (`logs/memory_log.md`) for transparency
* All agents can access search + log memory functions
* Memory can be exported, reviewed, and edited by user

#### 4. **Voice and I/O**

* Text input via `sim_user.py` or FastAPI
* Voice-to-text via Whisper (coming soon)
* Output as text or Edge TTS voice (via `voice_output.py`)
* Long-term goal: whispered Bluetooth audio (Magistus Whisper Mode™)

### 🧠 Reasoning Logic

#### `AgentThought` Schema

```python
{
  "agent_name": "prefrontal_cortex",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "content": "This decision is logically sound, but lacks emotional calibration.",
  "reasons": ["deductive logic", "previous memory match"],
  "requires_memory": True,
  "flags": {
    "contradiction": False,
    "insight": True
  }
}
```

* Central hub receives all `AgentThoughts`
* Checks for contradictions, priority flags, and fuses final response
* Can optionally **share previous thoughts between agents** for inter-agent reasoning

| **P7** | Refactor into long-term modular brain (clusters)   |
| **P8** | Extend to external tools, sensors, calendars, etc. |

### 🔒 Core Principles

* **Transparency-first**: memory is viewable, exportable, deletable
* **Modular by default**: everything is replaceable or extendable
* **Minimal dependencies**: no vendor lock-in
* **Neuro-inspired**: architecture is shaped by cognition
* **Companion, not controller**: Magistus supports the user, not replaces them
