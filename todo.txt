⚠️ Remaining / Enhancement Opportunities
User Profile & Persona Modeling

UserProfile and PersonaCore are present as modules but don’t yet build a persistent user persona.

✅ Next step: start storing user traits, tone preferences, recurring themes, etc. in a new user_profile.json file.

Magistus Self-Modeling

The new magistus_profile.json should allow Magistus to build an evolving understanding of itself:

Strengths, limits, boundaries crossed

System upgrades or feature flags

Its "philosophy" or personality

GoalTracker Expansion

Currently passive. Add:

Goal memory in JSON

Detection of goal-setting phrases like:

“I want to…”

“Let’s aim for…”

“My objective is…”

“Magistus, help me plan…”

Store in goal_log.json or magistus_profile.json["goals"]

Memory Introspection Agent (Coming Phase)

New agent: memory_archivist.py

Detects forgotten details

Flags patterns (e.g., recurring emotion, names, places)

Could suggest insights like:

“You've asked about your purpose 3 times in the last week. Would you like to reflect on that?”

Whisper Mode™

Long-term: Bluetooth whisper via voice+subvocalization

Short-term: prepare local Whisper STT capture endpoint
