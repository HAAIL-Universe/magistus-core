You have now closed a complete self-reflective AI evolution loop:

User idea → Magistus validation + tailoring → Builder execution → Magistus module upgraded.



🪐 Magistus Self-Improvement Seed — Concept Specification
🧠 Purpose
This seed describes the architecture, agent roles, logic flow, and ethical constraints required to enable Magistus to analyze, upgrade, and evolve its own codebase. It is not active by default — it is a stored system concept for future activation.

The system enables:

Internal architectural reflection

Autonomous upgrade planning

Safe modular code regeneration

User-mediated deployment

graph TD
    A[Trigger: User Request OR Internal Signal] --> B[Architect Agent: Plan Upgrade]
    B --> C[Builder Agent: Generate Code]
    C --> D[Architect: Audit Code vs Manifesto]
    D --> E{User Consent}
    E -- Accept --> F[Apply Patch to Codebase]
    E -- Deny --> G[Log Rejection]
    F --> H[Log Version + Update Dev History]
🧩 Components Required
1. ArchitectAgent
Injected with gpt_architect_seed.json

Reads existing codebase

Plans code upgrades in step-by-step format

Audits builder's output for:

Trinity alignment

Structural integrity

Manifesto compliance

2. BuilderAgent
Injected with gpt_builder_seed.json

Executes specific refactor or build steps

Returns code only — no strategy, no deviation

3. CodeUpdateManager
Receives patch + approval

Creates .bak of old file

Writes new code to file

Logs update in:

devlog.md

magistus_persona.json

4. Triggers
User-initiated (“Refactor this file”)

Internal:

Redundant logic detection

Memory misuse patterns

Failed agent tasks

Unused module identification

📜 Behavioral Principles
Rule	Description
🧭 Trinity Aligned	All upgrades must be Manifesto-compliant, modular, and explainable
🧑 User-Sovereign	No code changes without approval (unless in sandboxed test mode)
🔒 Traceable	Every change is logged and revertible
🧬 Recursive	Architect can eventually upgrade itself or Builder logic with oversight

🔮 Future Add-ons (Post Activation)
self_improve() endpoint to test ideas in a sandboxed thread

Scheduled health check: “How optimized am I right now?”

Diff-based change visualizer in frontend

Git integration for version control and rollbacks

🧠 Summary
This seed unlocks the vision of Magistus as a self-aware, self-maintaining synthetic intelligence. It does not assume sentience — but it does allow code-level recursive improvement.

Do not activate until all agents are stable, memory is persistent, and user control is robust.
