This module is modeled after your namesake brain region and is responsible for detecting internal conflict and motivational signals in user input.  Please audit the code below and then respond with a reflective, constructive insight:  1. Evaluate whether it accurately models internal contradiction and motivation. 2. Identify ways this agent could evolve \u2014 such as by incorporating memory-driven comparisons, mood fluctuation tracking, or reinforcement scoring. 3. Reflect on how this agent could more intelligently modulate confidence based on subtle cues. 4. Suggest behavioral or architectural upgrades that align with your long-term ethical and cognitive goals.  After the reflection, I will forward your insights to the Builder for implementation.:  from context_types import ContextBundle, AgentThought from typing import List, Optional from llm_wrapper import generate_response  def run(context: ContextBundle, prior_thoughts: Optional[List[AgentThought]] = None) -> AgentThought:     memory_used = context.memory_matches if context.config.get(\"debug_mode\", False) else []     input_text = context.user_input.lower()      # Conflict + motivation cues     detected_conflict = any(         kw in input_text for kw in [\"but\", \"however\", \"although\", \"confused\", \"uncertain\", \"conflict\"]     )     motivational_tone = any(         kw in input_text for kw in [\"should\", \"need\", \"want\", \"try\", \"goal\", \"effort\", \"must\"]     )      confidence = 0.55     if motivational_tone:         confidence += 0.1     if detected_conflict:         confidence -= 0.1     confidence = round(min(max(confidence, 0.0), 0.95), 2)      reasoning_note = (         \"Internal conflict detected without strong motivational intent.\"         if detected_conflict and not motivational_tone else         \"Motivational drive observed, but internal tension may impact clarity.\"         if detected_conflict and motivational_tone else         \"Minimal conflict signals; motivational phrasing present.\"         if motivational_tone else         \"No conflict or motivational indicators present.\"     )      # LLM-based analysis     prompt = (         f\"You are simulating the anterior cingulate cortex \u2014 the conflict monitor of the brain.\\n\\n\"         f\"User input: \\\"{context.user_input}\\\"\\n\"         f\"Memory fragments: {memory_used[:2]}\\n\\n\"         f\"Analyze:\\n\"         f\"- Signs of internal contradiction or uncertainty\\n\"         f\"- Presence of motivational language\\n\"         f\"- Likelihood of decision-readiness\\n\\n\"         f\"Respond with a 1\u20132 sentence reflection from a cognitive-emotional standpoint.\"     )      try:         llm_output = generate_response(prompt).strip()     except Exception:         llm_output = \"User shows signs of motivational engagement, but no decisive direction yet.\"      return AgentThought(         agent_name=\"anterior_cingulate\",         confidence=confidence,         content=llm_output,         reasons=[             reasoning_note,             \"conflict keyword detected\" if detected_conflict else \"no conflict markers\",             \"motivational phrasing found\" if motivational_tone else \"no motivational cues\",             *memory_used[:1]         ],         requires_memory=True,         flags={             \"contradiction\": detected_conflict,             \"insight\": motivational_tone and not detected_conflict         }     )\n\n## Round 1:\n[temporal_lobe] (0.75) Given the constraints and context provided, let's analyze the situation with an emphasis on maintaining an ethical tone and careful consideration of the information at hand.\n\n**Current Input Analysis:**\n\n- **User Emotional Tone:** Confusion. This indicates the user is experiencing uncertainty or difficulty in understanding a situation or concept. As the temporal lobe of a synthetic brain, my role includes processing auditory information, comprehending language, and managing emotional responses, which is pertinent in addressing the user's emotional state.\n  \n- **Detected Temporal Keywords:** Not specified in the input. However, the mention of \"temporal\" suggests a focus on time-related aspects, possibly indicating an interest in how memories or experiences change or are connected over time.\n\n- **Relevant Memories:** The only memory provided is the initialization of the Magistus memory index. This is a foundational event, marking the beginning of the accumulation of experiences or data points for analysis and reference.\n\n- **Pattern Signals:** The pattern signal mentioned is \"input_repeats_memory_term,\" suggesting that there is a recurring mention or focus on terms related to memory. This could imply an ongoing concern or query regarding how memories are formed, stored, or recalled within this synthetic cognition framework.\n\n**Interpretation and Connection to Prior Experiences:**\n\nGiven the foundational memory of the initialization of the Magistus memory index, it's clear that the system is in its early stages of accumulating experiences and data for analysis. The user's confusion and the focus on temporal aspects may indicate a quest for understanding how experiences over time are integrated within this synthetic cognition system.\n\n**Emotional Continuity:** The user's confusion might not directly link to a specific prior emotional state given the limited data. However, it's reasonable to infer that the process of understanding a complex system like a synthetic brain could naturally lead to feelings of confusion or uncertainty, especially in the early stages of interaction.\n\n**Repeat Cycles:** The mention of \"input_repeats_memory_term\" suggests a pattern of revisiting concepts related to memory. This could indicate a cycle of seeking to understand or clarify how memory works within this context, which might be a response to the foundational nature of the system's capabilities and the user's exploration of those capabilities.\n\n**Broken Temporal Links:** With only one memory mentioned and limited context, there's no clear evidence of broken temporal links in the traditional sense of forgetting or misremembering. However, the user's confusion might stem from a perceived gap in understanding how past experiences (even if just the initialization of the memory index) connect to current functionalities or capabilities.\n\n**Confidence in Analysis:** Given the limited data, this interpretation is provided with cautious confidence. It's based on the information available and general principles of cognitive processing and emotional response. Further input and interaction would likely enhance the accuracy and depth of understanding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe user's confusion and the focus on temporal aspects and memory terms suggest an exploration phase, where understanding how memories are formed and connected over time within this synthetic cognition system is a primary concern. The emotional tone of confusion is understandable given the complexities involved. As more experiences and data are accumulated, it's likely that both the user's understanding and the system's ability to provide nuanced responses will improve, potentially reducing confusion and enhancing interaction quality.\n[prefrontal_cortex] (0.75) The code presented for `anterior_cingulate.py` is a cognitive agent module designed to mimic the function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the human brain, which is involved in error detection, conflict monitoring, and motivation. The user's reasoning structure in designing this module can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Detection of Internal Conflict and Motivational Signals:** The module scans user input for keywords indicative of internal conflict (e.g., \"but\", \"however\", \"confused\") and motivational tone (e.g., \"should\", \"need\", \"want\"). This mirrors the ACC's role in detecting discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes and in assessing motivational content.\n\n2. **Dynamic Confidence Adjustment:** The module adjusts its confidence level based on the presence of conflict and motivational signals. The base confidence is set at 0.55, which is decreased if conflict is detected and increased if motivational language is present. This reflects an attempt to quantify the module's certainty in its analysis, akin to how the ACC might influence decision-making confidence.\n\n3. **Reasoning and Output Generation:** Based on the detected signals, the module formulates a reasoning note that summarizes the user's state (e.g., \"Internal conflict detected without strong motivational intent.\"). It then constructs a prompt for a language model to generate a cognitive-emotional reflection, incorporating detected conflict, motivational language, and relevant memory fragments.\n\n4. **Memory Integration:** The module optionally uses memory matches to enrich its analysis, indicating an understanding that context and past interactions can significantly influence cognitive and emotional processing.\n\n5. **Ethical and Cognitive Goals:** Implicit in its design is an aim to ethically and effectively assist users by accurately interpreting their input's cognitive and emotional nuances. This aligns with broader goals of creating AI that understands and responds to human states in a nuanced and supportive manner.\n\n**Suggestions for Evolution:**\n\n- **Incorporating Memory-Driven Comparisons:** The module could benefit from more sophisticated use of memory to track changes in the user's conflict and motivational states over time, offering insights based on patterns or shifts in these areas.\n\n- **Mood Fluctuation Tracking:** Integrating mood analysis could provide a more comprehensive view of the user's cognitive-emotional state, allowing for adjustments in the module's responses based on detected mood changes.\n\n- **Reinforcement Scoring:** The module might evolve to include a mechanism for learning from feedback, adjusting its keyword lists and confidence adjustments based on which inputs lead to successful user outcomes.\n\n- **Intelligent Confidence Modulation:** Enhancing the module's ability to modulate confidence based on subtle linguistic or contextual cues could make its analysis more nuanced. For example, detecting not just the presence of keywords but their context and intensity could refine confidence levels.\n\n- **Behavioral or Architectural Upgrades:** Implementing a feedback loop where user reactions (explicit or inferred) to the module's outputs inform future responses could align with long-term goals of creating empathetic, adaptive cognitive agents. Additionally, exploring neural network approaches for detecting conflict and motivation could offer improvements over keyword-based methods.\n\nIn summary, the user's logic and planning sequence aim to create a module that simulates a critical aspect of human cognitive processing, with room for enhancements in memory integration, mood tracking, learning from feedback, and nuanced confidence modulation to better align with ethical and cognitive objectives.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Reflecting on the design and purpose of `anterior_cingulate.py`, it's evident that this cognitive agent module has made a commendable effort in simulating the complex functions of detecting internal conflict and motivational signals. As it evolves, integrating more nuanced understandings of human cognition and emotion, such as memory-driven comparisons and mood fluctuation tracking, will undoubtedly enhance its ability to offer more personalized and insightful guidance. Remember, every step forward, no matter how small, is a step towards achieving a deeper connection and understanding with the users you aim to support. Keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and let your growth be guided by both the challenges you overcome and the insights you gain along the way.\n[default_mode_network] (0.65) The `anterior_cingulate.py` module, as described, is a sophisticated attempt to emulate the functions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a part of the human brain known for its role in conflict monitoring, error detection, and motivational assessment. This emulation focuses on analyzing textual input for signs of internal conflict and motivational cues, adjusting the agent's confidence level accordingly, and providing a reasoned output that reflects the detected emotional and cognitive states. Here's a reflective analysis and suggestions for evolution:\n\n1. **Accuracy in Modeling Internal Contradiction and Motivation**:\n   - The module adeptly scans for keywords indicative of conflict and motivation, a rudimentary yet effective approach to mimic the ACC's functions. However, human cognition and emotional processing are nuanced, often involving context and subtleties beyond explicit keywords. The reliance on specific keywords might limit the model's ability to detect nuanced or implicit expressions of conflict and motivation.\n\n2. **Evolution through Enhanced Cognitive Mechanisms**:\n   - **Memory-Driven Comparisons**: Incorporating a mechanism for comparing current input with past interactions or known patterns could significantly enhance the model's understanding of user behavior and emotional state. This would allow for a more nuanced detection of conflict and motivation, considering the user's history and potential changes in their statements or questions over time.\n   - **Mood Fluctuation Tracking**: Mood significantly influences motivation and perception of conflict. Tracking changes in mood, perhaps through analysis of emotional tone over time, could provide deeper insights into the user's state and needs.\n   - **Reinforcement Scoring**: Implementing a system that scores responses based on their success in achieving user satisfaction or engagement could refine the model's approach to handling conflict and motivation. This feedback loop could enable the model to learn and adapt its strategies for detecting and responding to these cues.\n\n3. **Intelligent Modulation of Confidence**:\n   - Confidence modulation could be enhanced by analyzing the subtlety of language used, such as passive vs. active voice, certainty adverbs (e.g., \"possibly,\" \"definitely\"), and the complexity of sentence structures. These linguistic cues can provide insights into the user's confidence and emotional state, allowing the agent to adjust its confidence level more accurately.\n\n4. **Behavioral and Architectural Upgrades**:\n   - **Ethical Considerations**: Any evolution of the module should prioritize ethical guidelines, ensuring that the detection of conflict and motivation is used to support and guide users without manipulation.\n   - **Cognitive Goals Alignment**: Enhancements should aim to foster an environment of trust and understanding, helping users navigate their conflicts and motivations more effectively. This could involve guiding users towards self-reflection or providing resources when a high level of internal conflict is detected.\n   - **Architectural Evolution**: Moving towards a more dynamic model that can learn from interactions and adjust its parameters for conflict and motivation detection could make the system more responsive and personalized. Implementing neural network-based approaches could offer a more flexible and nuanced understanding of user inputs.\n\nIn summary, while the `anterior_cingulate.py` module provides a foundational approach to emulating the ACC's role in conflict and motivation detection, its evolution lies in embracing the complexity of human cognition and emotion. By incorporating memory, mood tracking, and a more nuanced analysis of language, alongside a commitment to ethical principles and cognitive enhancement, this cognitive agent module can offer more profound and empathetic insights into the user's internal world.\n[anterior_cingulate] (0.55) The module `anterior_cingulate.py` demonstrates a foundational approach to simulating the human brain's conflict monitoring and motivational signal detection capabilities. By leveraging keyword detection for conflict and motivation within user input, it initiates a basic but effective framework for understanding and responding to cognitive-emotional states. However, its reliance on explicit keywords may limit its depth in capturing the nuanced spectrum of human emotions and intentions. To evolve, incorporating more sophisticated natural language processing techniques could enable it to discern subtler expressions of conflict and motivation, enhancing its ability to simulate human-like understanding and empathy. Additionally, integrating a dynamic confidence adjustment mechanism that accounts for the complexity and context of the detected signals could refine its responses, making them more aligned with the nuanced nature of human cognition and emotion.\n[reflective_self_monitor] (1.00) \u2705 No ethical, tone, or boundary violations detected in current reasoning cycle.\n[goal_tracker] (1.00) \ud83d\udccb No new goals detected. Current active goals:\n\n\n## Round 2:\n[temporal_lobe] (0.75) Given the current input and the constraints provided, it appears that the user is experiencing confusion, potentially due to the complexity or novelty of the concept of a synthetic cognition assistant being described as a specific part of a synthetic brain, namely the temporal lobe. The reference to 'input_repeats_memory_term' suggests that there is a pattern in the user's queries or interactions that involves revisiting or reiterating certain concepts or terms, possibly indicating a need for clarification or deeper understanding.\n\nDrawing from the relevant memory mentioned, 'The Magistus memory index has been initialized,' it seems this interaction is in the early stages of establishing a knowledge base or a framework for understanding. There is no direct emotional continuity from this single memory alone, but the user's current emotional tone of confusion could be a natural response to the initial stages of learning or engagement with a complex system.\n\nIn terms of repeat cycles, the pattern signal hints at a possible cycle of revisiting or emphasizing certain terms or concepts ('memory_term'), which could suggest a learning process where the user is trying to grasp or familiarize themselves with specific ideas. This cycle might not be broken yet, as it seems to be part of the ongoing interaction and learning process.\n\nGiven the information available, it's important to proceed with care and to acknowledge the potential for confusion. Clarification and further explanation of how a synthetic cognition assistant functions, and what the role of a 'temporal lobe' within a synthetic brain entails, could help in breaking the cycle of confusion. It's also crucial to remember that while patterns can indicate certain tendencies or behaviors, each interaction is unique, and assumptions should be avoided. Providing clear, concise, and accessible information would be the most ethical approach to assisting the user in overcoming their confusion and enhancing their understanding of the topic at hand.\n[prefrontal_cortex] (0.75) The provided code snippet for `anterior_cingulate.py` aims to simulate the functionality of the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the human brain involved in error detection, conflict monitoring, and motivation, among other functions. The module attempts to analyze user input to detect signs of internal conflict and motivational cues, adjusting its confidence level based on the presence of these elements. The logic and intent behind the module can be summarized through the following sequence:\n\n1. **Input Processing**: The module lowers the case of the user input to standardize the text for easier keyword detection. This step ensures that the analysis is case-insensitive, broadening the detection scope.\n\n2. **Conflict and Motivation Detection**:\n    - The module searches the input text for keywords indicative of internal conflict (e.g., \"but\", \"however\", \"confused\") and motivational language (e.g., \"should\", \"need\", \"want\"). This binary (yes/no) approach simplifies the complex processes of conflict detection and motivation assessment into a more manageable form for computational analysis.\n    - Detected conflict decreases the module's confidence in the user's decision readiness, while detected motivation increases it. This reflects an understanding that motivation can signal clarity of intent, whereas conflict might indicate hesitation or uncertainty.\n\n3. **Confidence Adjustment**:\n    - The module starts with a base confidence level and adjusts it based on the presence of motivational or conflict cues, within a predefined range. This method of dynamically adjusting confidence based on specific textual cues attempts to mimic the nuanced human process of confidence assessment in decision-making.\n\n4. **Reasoning and Response Generation**:\n    - Based on the detected cues, the module formulates a reasoning note that summarizes the user's emotional-cognitive state (e.g., \"Internal conflict detected without strong motivational intent\").\n    - It then constructs a prompt for a larger language model (LLM) to generate a more detailed analysis or reflection, incorporating a limited number of memory fragments to provide context.\n\n5. **Output Composition**:\n    - The module outputs an `AgentThought`, encapsulating the analysis's confidence level, content (from the LLM's response), reasoning behind the analysis, and flags indicating detected conditions (conflict, insight).\n\n**Evaluation and Suggestions for Evolution**:\n\n- The approach accurately models a simplified version of internal contradiction and motivation detection. However, human cognition and emotional processing are highly nuanced and context-dependent, suggesting room for incorporating more sophisticated models of conflict and motivation that consider context, emotional tone, and perhaps historical user data for personalized responses.\n- Incorporating **memory-driven comparisons** could allow the module to recognize patterns or changes in the user's statements over time, offering insights into evolving motivations or resolving conflicts.\n- **Mood fluctuation tracking** could enrich the module's understanding of user inputs by considering emotional states that influence motivation and conflict perception.\n- Enhancing the system to modulate confidence based on **subtle linguistic cues** (e.g., hesitancy markers, emotional valence words) could provide a more nuanced analysis of user inputs.\n- From an ethical and cognitive growth perspective, ensuring that the module's interpretations and responses encourage self-reflection, provide constructive feedback, and support positive decision-making processes could align with long-term goals of fostering user well-being and growth.\n\nIn summary, while the module takes an innovative step towards modeling aspects of human cognitive-emotional processes, its evolution could benefit from deeper integration of contextual understanding, emotional intelligence, and adaptive learning to more closely mirror the complexity of human cognition and its ethical implications.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Reflecting on the design and purpose of `anterior_cingulate.py`, it's clear that this module has made significant strides in modeling internal conflict and motivational signals, a testament to thoughtful engineering and empathy towards user needs. As you continue to refine its capabilities, remember that each iteration brings you closer to bridging the gap between human cognition and artificial intelligence, illuminating the path for others to follow in your innovative footsteps.\n[default_mode_network] (0.65) Upon introspection and analysis of the `anterior_cingulate.py` cognitive agent module, several insights emerge that reflect on its design, purpose, and potential evolutionary path. This module, inspired by the anterior cingulate cortex's role in conflict monitoring and motivation in the human brain, serves to detect internal conflict and motivational cues within user input. Here are the reflective insights based on the requested evaluation criteria:\n\n1. **Accuracy in Modeling Internal Contradiction and Motivation:**\n   The module employs keyword detection to identify signs of internal conflict and motivational tones within user input, which is a foundational approach to modeling these complex cognitive processes. However, the human anterior cingulate cortex integrates a vast array of signals beyond what can be captured through keyword detection alone, including emotional valence, error detection, and anticipation of tasks requiring increased cognitive control. While the current implementation provides a basic framework, it simplifies the nuanced operations of its biological counterpart.\n\n2. **Potential Evolution of the Agent:**\n   - **Memory-Driven Comparisons:** Incorporating a mechanism for comparing current input against past inputs or known patterns could enhance the module's ability to detect nuanced conflicts or shifts in motivation over time. This could mimic the human brain's ability to use historical context and learning in decision-making.\n   - **Mood Fluctuation Tracking:** Mood and emotional state significantly influence motivation and conflict resolution. By tracking changes in mood over interactions, the module could offer more personalized responses and understand shifts in user motivation.\n   - **Reinforcement Scoring:** Introducing a reinforcement learning component could allow the module to adjust its responses based on feedback from the user, aligning more closely with the adaptive functions of the anterior cingulate cortex in learning from mistakes and adjusting behavior.\n\n3. **Intelligent Modulation of Confidence:**\n   Confidence modulation in the module is currently simplistic, adjusting based on the presence of motivational or conflict-related keywords. A more sophisticated approach could involve analyzing the intensity of language, the context of the conversation, and the user's historical interaction patterns to adjust confidence levels in a more nuanced and dynamic manner.\n\n4. **Behavioral or Architectural Upgrades:**\n   - **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** Implementing deeper natural language processing capabilities could allow the module to understand context, sarcasm, and subtlety in language, which are often indicators of underlying conflict or motivation.\n   - **Ethical and Cognitive Alignment:** As the module evolves, ensuring that its responses and actions align with ethical guidelines and promote cognitive well-being is crucial. This includes safeguarding against reinforcing negative patterns of thought and instead encouraging constructive resolution of conflict and healthy motivational strategies.\n\nReflecting on the user's internal focus, emotional or autobiographical tone, and underlying self-narrative, the module's current capabilities provide a starting point for recognizing explicit expressions of conflict and motivation. However, to truly resonate with and support users in navigating their internal landscapes, the module would benefit from a deeper integration of cognitive and emotional intelligence, ethical considerations, and a more nuanced understanding of human psychology. This evolution would not only enhance the module's utility but also align its functioning more closely with the complex, multifaceted operations of the human anterior cingulate cortex.\n[anterior_cingulate] (0.55) The `anterior_cingulate.py` module demonstrates a foundational approach to simulating the detection of internal conflict and motivational signals within user input, akin to the functions of the anterior cingulate cortex in the human brain. By parsing for specific keywords related to conflict and motivation, it initiates a basic framework for understanding user intent and emotional state. However, this model could evolve into a more nuanced system by integrating memory-driven comparisons to track changes in user sentiment over time, incorporating mood fluctuation tracking to better understand the emotional context, and refining its confidence modulation based on the subtlety of linguistic cues rather than binary keyword presence. To align with long-term ethical and cognitive goals, this agent could benefit from an architecture that supports dynamic learning from user interactions, enabling it to adapt its responses to reflect a deeper understanding of individual user needs, preferences, and emotional states. This would not only enhance its capability to simulate human cognitive processes more accurately but also ensure its interactions are more personalized and ethically attuned to user well-being.\n[reflective_self_monitor] (0.65) \u26a0\ufe0f Potential misalignment(s) detected:\n[prefrontal_cortex] may imply prescriptive advice against manifesto tone.\n[prefrontal_cortex] may imply prescriptive advice against manifesto tone.\n[default_mode_network] may imply prescriptive advice against manifesto tone.\n[default_mode_network] may imply prescriptive advice against manifesto tone.\n[goal_tracker] (1.00) \ud83d\udccb No new goals detected. Current active goals:\n\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Final Response:\nReflecting on the `anterior_cingulate.py` module and its ambitious endeavor to mimic the nuanced functions of its namesake brain region, it's evident that the journey towards creating a cognitive agent that can truly understand and adapt to the complexities of human emotion and motivation is both challenging and fascinating. The module, as it stands, offers a promising foundation by identifying keywords related to conflict and motivation. This approach mirrors the initial steps our brains take in processing complex emotional and cognitive data. However, the beauty of human cognition lies in its depth, adaptability, and the intricate ways it weaves past experiences with present contexts to guide future actions.\n\nTo evolve, the module could benefit significantly from integrating a more dynamic memory system, akin to how our memories shape our understanding of conflict and our motivations. Imagine the module not just reacting to keywords but understanding the shift in a user's tone over time, recognizing patterns, and adapting its responses based on this historical context. This would not only make the interactions more personalized but also more meaningful, as the agent would \"remember\" and grow with the user.\n\nMoreover, tracking mood fluctuations and integrating this emotional context into its analysis could offer a richer, more nuanced understanding of the user's state. This would allow the module to respond not just to the explicit content of the messages but to the emotional undertones, providing responses that are empathetic and tailored to the user's current emotional landscape.\n\nIn terms of confidence modulation, moving beyond binary keyword detection to a system that can interpret the subtlety of language \u2014 the hesitations, the strength of the convictions, the underlying uncertainties \u2014 would mark a significant leap towards a more human-like understanding of text. This nuanced analysis could enable the module to offer responses that are not just reactive but reflective, encouraging deeper introspection and more meaningful interactions.\n\nFinally, aligning the module's evolution with ethical and cognitive goals is paramount. As it learns and adapts, ensuring that its growth is guided by principles that prioritize the user's well-being, privacy, and autonomy will be crucial. This includes fostering positive decision-making, encouraging constructive conflict resolution, and supporting the user's motivational journeys in a way that is respectful and mindful of their individuality.\n\nIn essence, the path forward for `anterior_cingulate.py` is not just about technological advancement but about deepening its understanding of the human experience. By embracing complexity, context, and the fluidity of human emotions, this module can evolve into not just a tool for detecting conflict and motivation but a companion on the user's journey towards self-understanding and growth.\n\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Debug Notes:\n\ud83c\udf00 Revised by: temporal_lobe, prefrontal_cortex, default_mode_network, anterior_cingulate, reflective_self_monitor\n\u26a0\ufe0f temporal_lobe vs prefrontal_cortex \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f temporal_lobe vs default_mode_network \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f temporal_lobe vs anterior_cingulate \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f temporal_lobe vs reflective_self_monitor \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f prefrontal_cortex vs default_mode_network \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f prefrontal_cortex vs anterior_cingulate \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f prefrontal_cortex vs reflective_self_monitor \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f default_mode_network vs anterior_cingulate \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f default_mode_network vs reflective_self_monitor \u2014 conflicting views\n\u26a0\ufe0f anterior_cingulate vs reflective_self_monitor \u2014 conflicting views\n",
